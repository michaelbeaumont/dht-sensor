# Contributing to `dht-sensor`

Thanks for your help with this project! I welcome any contributions, questions or suggestions of any kind or size, whether advanced or beginner.

## Pull requests

Please keep your PRs as semantically contained as possible. If you want to contribute more than one change,
or one change requires another but they are unrelated, please open more than one PR.
PRs will be squashed _at merge_. Use multiple commits, if the contribution is large enough to warrant them, to group changes within the PR.
Please aggressively rebase commits while the PR is open!

Also please mention with what MCU you're testing the library. If it's one that's not in `examples`, consider adding an example too!
